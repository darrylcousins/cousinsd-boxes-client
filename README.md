# shopify-boxes-client
Package to look after client side boxes app

To build for the app to use on the site run `npm run component`

To build for use as import Box within subscriber pages run `npm run build`

To upload it seems easiest to use theme-kit and run

```bash
theme deploy assets/boxes.bundle.js
```
